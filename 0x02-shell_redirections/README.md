# Shell, I/O Redirections and filters
This is the third project under the Software Engineering program.
The I/O Redirections and filters are accomplished using the operator (<, >, >>) which aids in the input and output of data to be redirected to a file.

### Files

**0-hello_world** - It prints "Hello, World", followed by a new line to the standard output.

**1-confused_smiley** - It displays a confused smiley "(Ôo)'.

**2-hellofile** - Displays the content of the /etc/passwd file.

**3-twofiles** - Displays the content of /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts.

**4-lastlines** - Displays the last 10 lines of /etc/passwd.

**5-firstlines** - Displays the first 10 lines of /etc/passwd.
