# Shell, I/O Redirections and filters
This is the third project under the Software Engineering program.
The I/O Redirections and filters are accomplished using the operator (<, >, >>) which aids in the input and output of data to be redirected to a file.

**1-confused_smiley** - It displays a confused smiley "(Ôo)'.
