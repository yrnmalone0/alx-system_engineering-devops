# Shell, I/O Redirections and filters
This is the third project under the Software Engineering program.
The I/O Redirections and filters are accomplished using the operator (<, >, >>) which aids in the input and output of data to be redirected to a file.

### Files

**0-hello_world** - It prints "Hello, World", followed by a new line to the standard output.

**1-confused_smiley** - It displays a confused smiley "(Ôo)'.

**2-hellofile** - Displays the content of the /etc/passwd file.

**3-twofiles** - Displays the content of /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts.

**4-lastlines** - Displays the last 10 lines of /etc/passwd.

**5-firstlines** - Displays the first 10 lines of /etc/passwd.

**6-third_line** - Displays the first the line of the file iacta.

**7-file** - Creates a file named exactly \*\\'"Best School"\'\\*$\?\*\*\*\*\*:) containing the text Best School ending by a new line.

**8-cwd_state** - It writes into the file ls_cwd_content the result of the command ls -la. If the file ls_cwd_content already exists, it should be overwritten. If the file ls_cwd_content does not exist, it will be created.

**9-duplicate_last_line** - Writes a script that duplicates the last line of the file iacta.

**10-no_more_js** - Writes a script that deletes all the regular files (not the directories) with a .js extension that are present in the current directory and all its subfolders.
